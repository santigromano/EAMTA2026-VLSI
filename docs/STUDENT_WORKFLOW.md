# Student Workflow (for advanced students)

This document describes the workflow for student groups working on the 4-bit counter project.

## Overview

Each student group will be assigned one or more blocks of the counter to design, verify, and layout. This workflow ensures proper collaboration and integration.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Setup and Assignment

1. **Check your assignment**: Look for your group's issue in the GitHub Issues tab
2. **Join your group**: Each group should have 2-3 students
3. **Understand your block**: Read the specifications in [DESIGN_SPECIFICATIONS.md](DESIGN_SPECIFICATIONS.md)
4. **Set up your environment**: Follow [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md)

### 2. Create Your Working Branch

```bash
# Update your local repository
git pull origin main

# Create a branch for your group
git checkout -b group-<N>/<block-name>
# Example: git checkout -b group-1/dff-design
```

### 3. Design Phase

#### 3.1 Schematic Design (xschem)

1. Create your block directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p design/blocks/<block-name>/schematic
   cd design/blocks/<block-name>/schematic
   ```

2. Create schematic in xschem:
   ```bash
   xschem <block-name>.sch
   ```

3. Design guidelines:
   - Use proper component naming
   - Add power and ground connections
   - Create a symbol for your block
   - Document pin functions in properties

4. Save both schematic (.sch) and symbol (.sym) files

#### 3.2 Simulation (ngspice)

1. Create a testbench:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p verification/testbenches/<block-name>
   cd verification/testbenches/<block-name>
   ```

2. Create testbench schematic in xschem:
   - Instantiate your block
   - Add stimulus sources
   - Add measurement probes

3. Generate netlist from xschem

4. Run simulation:
   ```bash
   ngspice <block-name>_tb.spice
   ```

5. Verify functionality:
   - Check logic operation
   - Measure timing parameters
   - Verify across corners (TT, FF, SS)

6. Document results in a README.md in your testbench directory

#### 3.3 Characterization (CACE)

1. Create CACE configuration:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p design/blocks/<block-name>/char
   cd design/blocks/<block-name>/char
   ```

2. Create CACE characterization file (<block-name>.yaml)

3. Run characterization:
   ```bash
   cace <block-name>.yaml
   ```

4. Review results and ensure specifications are met

#### 3.4 Layout (KLayout)

1. Create layout directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p design/blocks/<block-name>/layout
   cd design/blocks/<block-name>/layout
   ```

2. Create layout in KLayout:
   ```bash
   klayout -e -nn $PDK_ROOT/sg13g2/libs.tech/klayout/tech/sg13g2.lyt
   ```

3. Layout guidelines:
   - Follow DRC rules
   - Minimize area while meeting specifications
   - Proper power/ground routing
   - Add guard rings where appropriate

4. Run DRC:
   - Tools > DRC > Run DRC
   - Fix all violations

5. Run LVS:
   - Tools > LVS > Run LVS
   - Ensure schematic matches layout

6. Save layout in GDS format

### 4. Documentation

Create or update `design/blocks/<block-name>/README.md` with:

1. **Block Description**: Brief overview of functionality
2. **Specifications**: Key parameters and requirements
3. **Design Approach**: How you implemented it
4. **Simulation Results**: Key measurements and plots
5. **Layout**: Screenshots and area report
6. **Issues/Notes**: Any challenges or design decisions

### 5. Version Control

Commit your work regularly:

```bash
# Add your files
git add design/blocks/<block-name>/
git add verification/testbenches/<block-name>/

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Add <block-name> schematic and simulation"

# Push to your branch
git push origin group-<N>/<block-name>
```

### 6. Pull Request

When your block is complete and verified:

1. Push your final changes
2. Go to GitHub repository
3. Create a Pull Request from your branch to `main`
4. Fill in the PR template:
   - Description of your work
   - Verification results
   - Screenshots
   - Any issues or notes

5. Request review from instructors
6. Address any review comments
7. Wait for approval and merge

### 7. Integration

After individual blocks are merged:

1. Integration team will combine blocks into top-level design
2. System-level verification will be performed
3. Any issues will be reported back to groups

## Best Practices

### Git Practices

- **Commit often**: Small, logical commits are better than large ones
- **Descriptive messages**: Clearly describe what changed and why
- **Don't commit binaries**: Use .gitignore for generated files
- **Pull before push**: Always pull latest changes before pushing

### Design Practices

- **Start simple**: Get basic functionality working first
- **Test early**: Don't wait until design is complete to simulate
- **Document as you go**: Don't leave documentation for the end
- **Ask for help**: Use GitHub Issues or discussions if stuck

### Collaboration

- **Communicate**: Use GitHub Issues/Discussions for questions
- **Coordinate**: If your block depends on another, coordinate with that group
- **Review**: Review other groups' PRs when possible
- **Share**: Share useful tips or findings with the class

## File Organization

Your block directory should look like:

```
design/blocks/<block-name>/
├── README.md              # Block documentation
├── schematic/
│   ├── <block-name>.sch   # xschem schematic
│   └── <block-name>.sym   # xschem symbol
├── char/
│   ├── <block-name>.yaml  # CACE config
│   └── results/           # CACE results
└── layout/
    └── <block-name>.gds   # KLayout layout

verification/testbenches/<block-name>/
├── README.md              # Simulation results
├── <block-name>_tb.sch    # Testbench schematic
├── <block-name>_tb.spice  # Testbench netlist
└── plots/                 # Simulation plots
```

## Deliverables Checklist

Before submitting your PR, ensure:

- [ ] Schematic complete and properly documented
- [ ] Symbol created for hierarchical use
- [ ] Testbench demonstrates all functionality
- [ ] Simulations pass across all corners
- [ ] Timing specifications met
- [ ] CACE characterization complete
- [ ] Layout complete with DRC/LVS clean
- [ ] README.md with complete documentation
- [ ] All files committed to git

## Common Issues

### Issue: xschem can't find PDK components
**Solution**: Ensure PDK_ROOT environment variable is set and xschemrc is configured

### Issue: ngspice simulation errors
**Solution**: Check netlist for proper syntax, verify all models are included

### Issue: Layout DRC violations
**Solution**: Review PDK design rules, check minimum spacing and width requirements

### Issue: LVS mismatch
**Solution**: Verify all connections in layout match schematic, check pin names

### Issue: Git conflicts
**Solution**: This happens if you did a git pull after changing one file in the repo, but someone has already pushed another change before you. Therefore git doesn't know where to place the new change authored by you on the commit history. Use `git config --global pull.rebase false` followed by pull-commit-push to create a 'merge commit' that implements changes made by you and by the other person at the same time. Also, you can use `git config --global pull.rebase true` in case you haven't modified the same files as the other person (will pull the new changes and apply yours on top of those, as if you had done a git pull beforehand).
